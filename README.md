# Simple Tetris Game

This is a simple Tetris game; the twist is that most of the scripts are generated from ChatGPT, then modified by yours truly to fit my codebase. I also used another trusty AI from my software bootcamp, TripleTen, called "Dot", to assist me with any questions in refining the code. Dot's primary feature is that it won't give you answers directly; rather, it will point you in the right direction. This reinforces my learning and allows me to practice asking direct questions to get direct answers.
